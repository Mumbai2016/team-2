 <p class="lead">Hey folks,CacheBuffer presents you with its next blog on Deep Web Vs Dark Web.!</p>
      <p>Cachebuffer's latest update contains many terms ushered into existence because of technological advancements. Two of these new entries, deep web and dark web, are so technical in nature that we came across a lot of confusion as to what they actually mean in our research. More tech-savvy publications generally have a disclaimer when discussing the dark web, pleading with their readers that this is not to be confused with the deep web, which is related, but not at all the same thing. So, what exactly are the dark web and the deep web, and why are technology reporters so wary when using either term?
</p>

<p>
Technology defines deep web as the portion of the Internet that is hidden from conventional search engines, as by encryption; the aggregate of unindexed websites. The dark web, on the other hand, is defined as the portion of the Internet that is intentionally hidden from search engines, uses masked IP addresses, and is accessible only with a special web browser: part of the deep web. The key takeaway here is that the dark web is part of the deep web.</p>

<p>
The dark web and the deep web have been increasingly common in the news thanks to the heavily reported Silk Road trial. This particular Silk Road is an online black market that was shut down twice by the FBI between 2013 and 2014. In February 2015, Silk Roads founder Ross Ulbricht was convicted of various crimes, including several attempted murders-for-hire. Silk Road ran its operations on the dark web, which makes up a small percentage of the deep web.</p>
<p>
What the dark web and the deep web have in common is that they are both hidden from commercial search engines. You cannot access either from Google or Bing. The deep web is a general, catch-all term that includes the dark web, but also includes mundane content like registration-required web forums and dynamically-created pages like your Gmail account. That is to say, most of the deep web is irrelevant to the news stories about Silk Road.
</p>
<p>
While the deep web is vast and accounts for 90-something percent of the Internet, the dark web likely only accounts for only about .01 percent. The dark web, sometimes referred to as Darknet, is accessed by Tor (The Onion Router) or I2P (Invisible Internet Project), which use masked IP addresses to maintain anonymity for users and site owners. This way, people who use the dark web for illegal purposes cant be traced.
</p>
<p>
Facebook recently launched a version of its site on the dark web to make it easier to access the site from countries that restrict the service, such as China and Iran.
</p>
<p>
One common misconception about the dark web and the deep web is that these two terms are interchangeable. This is simply not true. Take, for example, this sentence in Business Insider: The Dark (or Deep) Web, which refers to areas of the Internet normally inaccessible to users without special anonymizing software, first came to prominence with the Silk Road trial. While, yes, both the deep and dark web have been featured in news stories about Silk Road, this writer is clearly referring specifically to the dark web, which is just a tiny portion of the deep web where users employ masked IP addresses to conceal their identity. A similar mistake is made by comedian Hannibal Buress in a Funny or Die spoof of the Webby Awards called The Deep Webbys. Awards include Most Stolen Identity, Leakiest Wiki, and The Peoples Choice Award for the Trafficking of the Choicest People. Though his delivery is pristine, this is another example of deep web being confused for dark web. The sorts of illegal activities and documents named in these awards are bought, sold, hosted via the dark web. The Deep Webbys is too broad a title; the awards should technically be called the Dark Webbys, a distinction that Buress, Funny or Die, and the A.V. Club, which reported on Buress video, missed.
</p>
<p>
If people keep confusing the terms dark web and deep web, will the definition eventually change and expand.....Will deep web start to mean both the deep web and the dark web, with disambiguation only to be achieved by context? This would not be the first time.........</p>
